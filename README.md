# fast-z

Fast-Z is a fastify domain generator tool i made to skip the repeatitive process of creating a new folder with X name then making 4 sub files and copy code here and there. Thus, this tool handles that for me.

## how to use the tool

first you have to initialize the tool in ur root dir by running:

```
npx fastzx i
```

you will have to specify the domains parent folder path e.g. /src/domains. the tool will generate a fastz.config.json file in the same dir. there u can edit the domainPath field if u want to change the domains parent folder destination.

to generate a domain simply run (in the root dir):

```
npx fastzx c
```
